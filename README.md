## 🌸 About the Project

This static website was created as part of **Extra Assignment Bundle E**  
to demonstrate the use of **GitHub Pages** and **Markdown syntax**.

It also represents my creative brand — *Duck by Kudrina* —  
where I design eco-friendly crochet bags and accessories inspired by Nordic simplicity.

> “Crocheting calms in the process and brings joy in the result.”
